      "p3": "While many retailers may display very high TC values, such as 600 TC, to create an image of luxury, this can result from counting multi-ply threads or measuring in a smaller-than-standard area, like 1 square inch, without proper conversion. This inflates the numbers without reflecting the true quality of the fabric, potentially distorting product comparisons.",
      "p4": "For materials, we select high-quality natural fibers such as 100% Combed Cotton, TENCEL‚Ñ¢, and Bamboo Rayon that are OEKO-TEX¬Æ certified, free from irritating residues, even for sensitive skin. This is combined with High-Density Weave technology, which makes the fabric soft, dense, not thin, wrinkle-resistant, and breathable.",

    "faq": {
      "title": "Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)",
      "item1": { "q": "How do hotel bed sheets differ from regular ones?", "a": "Hotel sheets often use higher quality fibers (e.g., Long-Staple Cotton, Tencel‚Ñ¢), a thread density suitable for durability and frequent washing, are resistant to heat and chemicals, have stronger stitching, and favor white or solid colors for a clean, luxurious look." },
      "item2": { "q": "Which type of Cotton is best for hotels?", "a": "‚ÄúCombed Cotton‚Äù from long fibers (like Egyptian or Pima Cotton) is a high standard for hotel sheets because it's soft, durable, breathable, and doesn't pill easily after many washes." },
      "item3": { "q": "Are there no-iron bed sheets?", "a": "Tencel‚Ñ¢ fabric is significantly more wrinkle-resistant than Cotton and provides a soft, glossy feel without heavy ironing. Cotton-Polyester blends (like our CVC or Soft-Tex‚Ñ¢) are also wrinkle-resistant and easy to care for, ideal for those who dislike ironing or hotels looking to reduce care steps." },
      "item4": { "q": "How to care for different types of bed sheets?", "a": "Generally, wash in cool or warm water (up to 40¬∞C), use a low spin cycle, air dry in the shade or tumble dry on low heat, and avoid chlorine bleach on colored fabrics. However, please refer to the specific care instructions on the product label or ask us." }

      "step2_title": "2. Use a Normal to High Water Level",

      "step2_practice_item1": "<strong>Practice:</strong> Do not overload the washing machine. Wash towels in manageable batches.",
      "step3_title": "3. Wash with Warm Water (40-60¬∞C)",
      "step3_reason": "<strong>Reason:</strong> Warm water is highly effective at opening up the cotton fibers, which helps to wash away any finishing coatings and residual lint from the manufacturing process.",
      "step3_practice_item1": "<strong>Practice:</strong> Select a warm wash cycle on your machine. Avoid excessively hot water on the first wash as it can be harsh on new fibers.",
      "step4_title": "4. Use a Mild Detergent",
      "step4_reason": "<strong>Reason:</strong> Harsh detergents can damage the cotton fibers. A mild detergent is sufficient to clean the new towels.",
      "step4_practice_item1": "<strong>Practice:</strong> Use about half the recommended amount of a gentle, liquid detergent.",
      "step5_title": "5. Add Distilled White Vinegar (Optional but Recommended)",
      "step5_reason": "<strong>Reason:</strong> Vinegar helps to dissolve detergent residue and break down any waxy finishes on the towels, which significantly boosts their absorbency. It also acts as a natural fabric softener.",
      "step5_practice_item1": "<strong>Practice:</strong> Add one cup (approx. 240 ml) of distilled white vinegar to the rinse cycle.",
      "step6_title": "6. Avoid Fabric Softener",
      "step6_reason": "<strong>Reason:</strong> Commercial fabric softeners coat the fibers with a waxy, water-repellent film that drastically reduces a towel's absorbency. This is the #1 enemy of a thirsty towel.",
      "step7_title": "7. Double Rinse If Possible",
      "step7_reason": "<strong>Reason:</strong> An extra rinse cycle ensures all detergent and loose lint are completely washed away.",
      "step8_title": "8. Shake Towels Before Drying",
      "step8_reason": "<strong>Reason:</strong> Vigorously shaking out each towel helps to fluff up the terry loops, which aids in drying and improves softness.",
      "step9_title": "9. Tumble Dry on Medium Heat",
      "step9_reason": "<strong>Reason:</strong> Over-drying or using excessively high heat can damage the cotton fibers, making them brittle and less soft over time. Medium heat is sufficient to dry them while keeping them plush.",
      "step10_title": "10. Clean the Lint Filter",
      "step10_reason": "<strong>Reason:</strong> New towels will release a significant amount of lint during the first few washes. Clean your dryer's lint filter mid-cycle and after drying to ensure good airflow and prevent fire hazards."
